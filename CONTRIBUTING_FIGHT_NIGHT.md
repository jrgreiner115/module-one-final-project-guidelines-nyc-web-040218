#HOW TO CONTRIBUTE TO UFC FIGHT NIGHT

Any and all contributions are welcome to UFC Fight Night. We had a lot of fun with this project, but if anyone wants to take it further, we welcome it!

If you would like to make any edits and additions to the game, go for it. We'd ask that you create a branch for your development, and submit a Pull Request. If we like what you've created, we'll add it to the master!

You're also welcome to Fork & Clone the repo and submit a Pull Request. We'll look at that, too.

Most of all, thanks for looking!

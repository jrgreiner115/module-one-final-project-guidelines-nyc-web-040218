# UFC Fight Night Game/Database Browser

For our Module 1 final project we seeded a database with the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Champion) fighters’ API via Active Record.  We used each fighter’s statistics to create a rating for them; this rating utilized each fighter’s weight-class, speed, win/loss record, title status, and we added a randomness factor because you never know when someone might slip on a banana peel and lose the fight.  Then we created a user class, seeded this class through a series of questions via CLI, and calculated a rating for the user based on their answers to their questions as well as a randomness factor.  

   We created several methods to access choose who you want to fight: pick a random fighter, 50 best fighters, 50 worst fighters etc.  In addition we constructed several methods for fun such as find the fighter with the longest name, and find a UFC fighter that is in the Welterweight class with the most losses, who is not currently fighting.  

   A somewhat silly story line and some basic artwork added the finishing touches to our project.  As you play the game will update your record and change your rating based on your success and/or failure in the ring, as well as your opponents.
